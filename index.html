        class="In geophysical terms the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as Australia.[17]) Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth largest and most massive moon overall, and larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and the second highest among all Solar System moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.">

    <p class="odd">The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge for humans, having been crucial to
        cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. In 1959 the first
        human-made objects to leave Earth and reach another body arrived at the Moon, with the flyby of the Soviet
        Union's Luna 1 and the intentional impact of Luna 2. In 1966, the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body
        where soft landings and orbital insertions were achieved. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on
        the Moon and any extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle of the United States'
        Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface.
        The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Since then, exploration of the Moon has continued
        robotically, and crewed missions are being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s.</p>

    <p class="even">The English adjective pertaining to the Moon is "lunar", derived from the Latin word for the Moon,
        lūna. Selenian /səliːniən/[28] is an adjective used to describe the Moon as a world, rather than as a celestial
        object,[29] but its use is rare. It is derived from σελήνη selēnē, the Greek word for the Moon, and its cognate
        selenic was originally a rare synonym[30] but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.[31] The
        element name selenium and the prefix seleno- (as in selenography, the study of the physical features of the
        Moon) come from this Greek word.[32][33]</p>
